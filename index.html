        First of all wishing U very Happiest Birthday. I know things are not
        good between us but I have a deep soft corner for you in my heart and it
        will remain always. You’re my calm, my chaos, my favorite chapter, and
        my sukoon. You mean more to me than words can say. Thank you for being
        you — beautiful inside. Always wanted to be yours but I am not enough
        for you. The lines I always say to you -- Tu bas de de mera sath..💞
